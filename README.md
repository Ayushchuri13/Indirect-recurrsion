# Indirect-recurrsion


What is Recursion?
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

Types of Recursions:
Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one another mutually. The first one is called direct recursion and another one is called indirect recursion.


Indirect Recursion: In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circularÂ manner.
